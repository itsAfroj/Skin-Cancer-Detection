# Skin Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project aims to detect skin cancer using machine learning techniques. The purpose of this project is to provide a tool that can help in the early detection of skin cancer by analyzing images of skin lesions. The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify skin lesions into different categories, such as benign and malignant.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itsAfroj/Project.git
   cd Project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the local server:
   ```
   cd App/local-server
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:81` to access the web application.

## How to Use the Project

1. Upload an image of a skin lesion by clicking the "Upload Image" button on the homepage.
2. The model will automatically analyze the image and display the top three predicted diagnoses along with their probability scores.
3. You can view more information about the project and the different types of skin lesions by clicking the "About" link on the homepage.
